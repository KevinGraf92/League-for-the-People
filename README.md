# League-for-the-People
Fantasy Football website created as a ongoing project to learn web programming and developmet. The project was initally started to have a place where i can consolidate leage history, live updates, and games of the week. This will be an ongoig and ever updaed project for years to come. I hope to be able to acomplish with this site ongoing improvments as I continue to lean, and better understand how to utlize programming languages to my advantage.

The 3 features utilized were navigation menu collapse, css flex box, some javaScript than displays the league winners at the bottom of the main page. I utilized the flexbox and navigation menu inside the media queries. The javaScript was used at the bottom of the league.html file. Its a simple script to show all of the past champions of the league once the box is clicked.
